FinancialLiteracy
=================
This is a project to gauge the efficacy of financial literacy in five counties in North Carolina. As an initial part of that research, we will produce a map which shows concentrations of wealth and access to financial services of all types. Those services encompass traditional institutions such as banks, but also non-traditional sources of finance such as payday lenders, pawn shops, rent-to-own stores and so forth.

This work has been inspired by and is being carried out in cooperation with The United Way of the Greater Triangle.
